Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to develop machine learning models to assess credit risk using historical lending data. The dataset provided included various financial attributes of borrowers such as loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks, total debt, and loan status. The objective was to predict whether a loan is healthy (0) or presents a high risk of defaulting (1).

The stages of the machine learning process involved:

Data preprocessing: This step involved reading the dataset, segregating features and labels, and dividing the data into training and testing sets.
Model training: Logistic regression was chosen as the algorithm to train the model on the training dataset.
Model evaluation: Confusion matrices and classification reports were generated to assess the model's performance.
Results
Logistic Regression Model:
Accuracy: 0.99
Precision (0 - Healthy Loan): 1.00
Precision (1 - High-Risk Loan): 0.86
Recall (0 - Healthy Loan): 1.00
Recall (1 - High-Risk Loan): 0.91
Summary
The logistic regression model demonstrated outstanding performance in predicting both healthy loans and high-risk loans. With high accuracy, precision, and recall scores for both labels, the model proves its effectiveness in identifying loan risk. Given the critical importance of correctly predicting both types of loans to mitigate financial risks, I recommend utilizing the logistic regression model for credit risk assessment based on the provided dataset.
